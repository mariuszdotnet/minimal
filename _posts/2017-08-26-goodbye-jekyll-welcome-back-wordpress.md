## {{page.title}}

Today I made the switch back from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) to [WordPress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery) hosted on an [Azure App Service Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/) with [Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/) as the backend.

The key decision factor was ease of publishing and editing content. As much as I enjoyed using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) the overall experience is till fairly time intensive.  
The other aspect was customization of features.

Github.io thanks for the ride, however WordPress is still #1 in my book.
